  @moduledoc """
  A "middleware" is a component that sits between the HTTP server
  such as as [Ace](https://github.com/CrowdHailer/Ace) and a `Raxx.Server` controller.
  The middleware can modify requests request before giving it to the controller and
  modify the controllers response before it's given to the server.

  Oftentimes multiple middlewaress might be attached to a controller and
  function as a single `t:Raxx.Server.t/0` - see `Raxx.Stack` for details.

  The `Raxx.Middleware` provides a behaviour to be implemented by middlewares.

  ## Example

  Traditionally, middlewares are used for a variety of purposes: managing CORS,
  CSRF protection, logging, error handling, and many more. This example shows
  a middleware that given a HEAD request "translates" it to a GET one, hands
  it over to the controller and strips the response body transforms the
  response according to [RFC 2616](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.13)

  This way the controller doesn't heed to handle the HEAD case at all.

      defmodule Raxx.Middleware.Head do
        alias Raxx.Server
        alias Raxx.Middleware

        @behaviour Middleware

        @impl Middleware
        def process_head(request = %{method: :HEAD}, _config, inner_server) do
          request = %{request | method: :GET}
          state = :engage
          {parts, inner_server} = Server.handle_head(inner_server, request)

          parts = modify_response_parts(parts, state)
          {parts, state, inner_server}
        end

        def process_head(request = %{method: _}, _config, inner_server) do
          {parts, inner_server} = Server.handle_head(inner_server, request)
          {parts, :disengage, inner_server}
        end

        @impl Middleware
        def process_data(data, state, inner_server) do
          {parts, inner_server} = Server.handle_data(inner_server, data)
          parts = modify_response_parts(parts, state)
          {parts, state, inner_server}
        end

        @impl Middleware
        def process_tail(tail, state, inner_server) do
          {parts, inner_server} = Server.handle_tail(inner_server, tail)
          parts = modify_response_parts(parts, state)
          {parts, state, inner_server}
        end

        @impl Middleware
        def process_info(info, state, inner_server) do
          {parts, inner_server} = Server.handle_info(inner_server, info)
          parts = modify_response_parts(parts, state)
          {parts, state, inner_server}
        end

        defp modify_response_parts(parts, :disengage) do
          parts
        end

        defp modify_response_parts(parts, :engage) do
          Enum.flat_map(parts, &do_handle_response_part(&1))
        end

        defp do_handle_response_part(response = %Raxx.Response{}) do
          # the content-length will remain the same
          [%Raxx.Response{response | body: false}]
        end

        defp do_handle_response_part(%Raxx.Data{}) do
          []
        end

        defp do_handle_response_part(%Raxx.Tail{}) do
          []
        end
      end

  Within the callback implementations the middleware should call through
  to the "inner" server and make sure to return its updated state as part
  of the `t:Raxx.Middleware.next/0` tuple.

  In certain situations the middleware might want to short-circuit processing
  of the incoming messages, bypassing the server. In that case, it should not
  call through using `Raxx.Server`'s `handle_*` helper functions and return
  the `inner_server` unmodified.

  NOTE: As you can see in the above example, the middleware can even modify
  the `info` messages sent to the server and is responsible for forwarding them.
